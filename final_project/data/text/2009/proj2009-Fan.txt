Introduction  
The prediction of  the function of a novel 
gene 
remains 
to  be  a  challenging 
problem.  Given  a  piece  of  coding 
sequence, one can deduce  its function by 
finding 
homologous 
genes 
using 
sequence or protein structural alignment. 
One  can  also  perform  gene  expression 
measurements 
or 
gene 
knockout 
experiments  to determine  the function of  
a  gene.  However,  a  gene  may  not  have 
homology  with  any  known  gene  and 
experiments  can  be  expensive.  It  would 
therefore  be  beneficial  if  the  function  of 
a  gene  can  be  predicted  from 
the 
characteristics  of  its  coding  sequence. 
One  such  characteristics  is  synonymous 
codon usage.  
 
Proteins  are  strings  of  amino  acids  and 
their  sequences  are 
translated  from 
nucleotide  sequences  using  the  genetic 
code,  which  is  a  set  of  trinucleotide 
sequences. Each trinucleotide is termed a 
codon.  Proteins  are  constructed  from  20 
different  amino  acids,  yet  there  are  43  = 
64  different  codons.  The  genetic  code  is 
therefore  redundant  -  most  amino  acids 
are  encoded  by  more  than  one  codon 
(Table  1).  Trinucleotide 
sequences 
coding  for  the  same  amino  acids  are 
referred  to  as  synonymous  codons.  The 
usage  of  synonymous  codons  is  not 
random  –  some  codons  are  preferred 
over  the  others  for  a  given  amino  acid 
and  such  perference  varies  among 
species  as well  as  among  genes within  a 
species.  
 
It  has  been  shown  that  for  a  number  of 
organisms such as yeast, bacteria, plants, 

insect,  and  mammals,  genes  can  be 
clustered  into  groups  that  have  different 
expression  patterns  and  functions  based 
on  codon  usage  (1).  In  this  project,  I 
focused 
on 
baker's 
yeast 
(Saccharomyces  cerevisiae),  which  is  a 
unicellular  eukaryote 
that  has  been 
studied extensively as a model organism.  
Sharp  et.  Al  demonstrated  that  yeast 
genes  can  be  seggregated  into  two  main 
clusters  with  different  expression  levels 
based  on  synonymous  codon  usage  (2). 
Najafabadi  et.  Al  showed 
that  co-
expressed  genes  in  yeast  have  similar  
synonymous codon usage and that codon 
usage  can  improve  the  prediction  of 
protein-protein  interaction  in  organisms 
including  yeast  (3,4). Here,  I would  like 
to  build  a  classifier  to  predict  the 
function  of  a  gene,  using  yeast  as  a 
model.

Methods  
Data  
Yeast  genes  that  participated  in  various 
molecular  pathways were  retrieved  from 

the  KEGG  (Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  
Genes  and Genomes)  Pathway  database.  
The  categories  chosen  for  this  study 
included  those  involved  in  metabolism, 
DNA 
replication  and 
transcription, 
translation, 
cellular  processes.  
and 
Details  of  the  chosen  pathways  are 
presented  in  Table  2.  Coding  sequences 
of  the  genes  were  retrieved  from  the 
Saccharomyces  Genome  Database 
(SGB).  Duplicated  copies  of  genes 
within  the  same  category were  removed.  
Genes  that were  found  in more  than  one 
categories  were  ignored.  Only  genes 
with  more 
than  100  codons  were 
considered.  The  final  data  set  had  891 
genes. 
 
Feature Space  
There  are 64 different  codons. However, 
since  methionine  and  tryptophan  have 
only  1  corresponding  codon,  these  two 
codons  do  not  contribute 
to 
the 
measurement  of  codon  usage  and  are 
removed  from  the  analysis.  Also,   stop 
codons  that  signal  the  termination  of 
transcription  are  also  removed.  Each 
gene  is  therefore  represented by  a vector 
containing  59  elements,  each  element 
corresponds  to  the  relative  synonymous 
codon usage frequency (RSCU) (fij) (2),    
 

f ij =

where  xij  is  the  number  of  ocurrences  of  
synonymous codon j of amino acid i and 
ni  is  the  number  of  synonymous  codons 
encoding  for  amino  acid  i. This measure 
can  be 
the  observed 
interpreted  as 
number  of  occurrence  of  codon  i  versus 
the  expected  number  of  occurrence  of  
codon  i  given  an  amino  acid  j  assuming 
distribution. 
uniform 
the 
has 
It 
advantage  of  removing  the  effect  of  

amino  acid  composition  on  the  codon 
usage  profile  of   a  gene. Since  a  gene 
does  not  necessarily  carry  all  20  amino 
acids, a pseudo-count (+1) was added for 
every codon.  
 
Data Analysis  
Calculation  of  codon  usage  and  building 
of  learning  algorithms  were  done  in 
Matlab.  
 
 
Supervised Learning Algorithms  
1. Softmax Regression  
Softmax  regression  is  an  example  of 
Generalized  Linear  Model  applied  to 
multinomial  data.  The  model  takes  the 
feature vector of each gene with  its  label 
in 
the 
training  set  and  output 
the 
probabilities of a test sample being in the 
different  classes.  The  parameters  were 
found  by  maximizing  the  log-likelihood 
with  batch  gradient  ascent.  The  class 
with the higest probability was chosen to 
be the predicted class.  
 
2. Support vector machines (SVM) 
Ma  et.  Al  (5)  demonstrated  the  use  of  
SVM  for  the  classification  of  human 
leukocyte  antigens  using  codon  usage.  
SVMs    are  inherently  a  two-class model 
but  they  can  be  extended  to  multiple 
classes.  Two  common ways  are  the  one-
versus-all method, where k SVM models 
are built, one for each of  the k classes. A 
test  sample  is  assigned  to  the  class  that 
classifies  it with  the  largest margin.  The 
second  approach  is  the  one-versus-one 
model,  where  k(k-1)/2  models  are  built. 
Each  model  is  built  for  a  pair  of  the 
classes.  The  label  of  a  test  sample  will 
be  the  class  that  are  chosen  by  most 
models. Here, I used the later approach.  
 
Evaluation of Learning Algorithms  
Ten-fold  cross  validation  was  used  to 
evaluate 
the  performance  of 
the 

the  remaining  subset  was  used  for 
testing.  The  testing  error  was  calculated 
as  the  average  of  the  testing  errors  from 
all ten validations.  
 

classifiers.  Briefly,  the  data  set  was 
partitioned 
of 
subsets 
10 
into 
approximately  equal  size,  each  subset 
containing  equal  proportion  of  genes 
from  each  category.  In  each  validation, 
nine  subsets  were  used  for  training  and

Results 
Principal Component Analysis 
The  data  set  of  891  yeast  genes,  each 
represented  by  a  feature  vector  of  59 
elements,  was 
principal

subject 
component  analysis.  The  first  two  principal 
components  explained  37%  and  11 % of  the 
total  variance,  repsectively.  Figure  1  shows 
the  representation  of  each  gene  in  the  space 
spanned  by 
the 
first 
two  princiapl 
components.  It  was  obvious  from  Figure  1 
that  different  functional  categories  of  genes 
occupied different spaces defined by the first 
two components, except for the categories of 
DNA  replication/transcription  and  cellular 
processes (Figure 1, right panels). These two 
groups  were  thus  grouped  together  for  the 
building  of  gene 
function  classifiers. 
Interestingly,  ten  of  the  genes  partitcipating 
in  the  oxidative  phosphorylation  pathway 
were  located  in  unique  location  in  the 

177

principal component space (Figure 1, bottom 
panel).  Further  exmination  of  the  data  set 
revealed 
that 
they  were  genes 
in 
the 
mitochondria,  a  DNA  continaing  organelle 
that  participates  in  energy  metabolism  in 
eukaryotes  and  is  believed  to  be  derived 
from  endosymbiotic  prokaryotes.  It  was 
therefore  not  surprising  that  mitochondrial 
genes  have  synonymous  codon  usage  very 
different  from  nuclear  genes.  None  of  the 
other  pathways  contained  mitochondrial 
genes.  These  ten  genes  were  removed  from 
the  data  set  for  training.  The  final  data  set 
thus consisted of 881 nuclear genes. 
 
Figure 2  is  a plot of  the  contribution of  each 
codon  to  the  first  two principal  components. 
One  interesting  observation was  that  codons 
ending with A or T  contributed positively  to 
the  second  principal  component  while  those 
ending  with  G  or  C  contributed  negatively.

three

built 
were 
classes/categories  using  881  nuclear  genes.  
Category  1  corresponded  to  genes  involved  in 
metabolism;  category  2  corresponded  to  genes 
involved  in DNA  replication,  transcription,  and 
cellular  processes;  category  3  corresponded  to 
ribosomes. 
 
Softmax regression 
Using  batch  gradient  descent  with  a  learning 
rate  of  0.0001,  yeast  genes were  classified  into 
3  categories  based  on  their  codon  usage.  Table 

3  shows  the  confusion matrix  summed  over  all 
ten  validations  (i.e.  each  cross  validation 
generated a confusion matrix and Table 3  is  the 
sum  of  all  10  confusion  matrices,  such  that 
each  gene  was  classified  once).  The  average 
test  error  (percentage  of  genes  misclassified) 
was  21.6%  ,  which  was  close  to  the  training 
error.  Most  of 
in  category  1 
the  genes 
(metabolism)  that  were  misclassified  fell  into 
category  2 
(DNA 
replication, 
translation, 
cellular  processes).  The  specificity  of  category 
2 (number of  true category 2 genes  / number of 
genes classified  into  category 2) was quite  low,  

~62%.  This  was  not  surprising,  since  some  of  
the  category  1  genes  fell  into  similar  space 
defined  by  the  first  two  principal  components 
as category 2 (Figure 1).

Support Vector Machines 
Three  regularized  SVMs  were  built,  one  for 
each category pair (categories 1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3, 1 
vs.  3).  A  gene  was  classified  into  category  i  if  
both SVMs  involving  category  i gave  the  same 
prediction  i.  If  the prediction of  any  two SVMs 
disagreed, no  prediction was made  for  the gene 
and  such  event  was  termed  'uninformative'. 
Different  kernels  and  values  for  C, 
the 
parameter  that  controls  the  weighting  of  the 
slack  variables,  were  experimented.  Tables  4 
and  5  list  the  training  error,  test  error,  and 
uninformative  rate  of  the  multi-class  SVM 
using  polynomial  (linear,  quadratic,  and  cubic) 
and  Gaussian  kernels,  respectively,  after  ten-
fold  cross-validation.  Decreasing  C  reduced 
overfitting, as seen from the increase in training 
error.  Quadratic  and  cubic  kernels  tended  to 
overfit  the  data,  as  observed  from  the  zero 
training  error  and  relatively  high  test  error 
rates.  Linear  kernels  performed  better  than 
cubic  and quadratic kernels. The best  error  rate 
of  the  multi-class  SVM  was  18.07%,  which 
was  obtained  using  a  Gaussian  kernel.  Such 
eror  rate  was  better  than  that  obtained  from 
softmax  regression.  Table  6  is  the  confusion 
matrix with the best error rate.

Conclusion 
The  function  of  yeast  genes  could  be  predicted 
fairly  well  based  solely  on 
the  coding 
sequences. 
In 
this  study,  one-versus-one 
support  vector machine with  a Gaussian  kernel 
performed  better  than  softmax  regression.  It 
would  be  interesting  to  investigate  whether  the 
use of codon usage for gene prediction could be 
extended  to  other  organisms  including  higher  
level eukaryotes.
