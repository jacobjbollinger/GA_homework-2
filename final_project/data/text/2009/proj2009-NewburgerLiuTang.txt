1. Introduction 
Complex  genetic  diseases  are  a  major  cause  of 
human  morbidity  and  mortality,  and  their  preva-
lence  and  severity  place  a  tremendous  burden  on 
patients  and  medical  facilities  [1,2].  Preventive 
care  studies  have  shown  that  identification  of  pa-
tients  at  risk  for  disease  and  prediction  of  patient 
age at  disease onset  improve  patient  outcome  and 
reduce  health  care  costs  [2].   However,  the  devel-
opment  of  accurate  predictive  methods  remains  in 
preliminary stages. 
     Recent  research  suggests  that  methods  for  ana-
lyzing  combinatorial  interactions  of  single  nucleo-
tide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  can  lead  to  effective 
predictors  for  disease  [3].   SNPs,  which  are  single 
allele mutations  in  the  genomic  sequence  of  an  or-
ganism, are responsible for about 90% of all human 
DNA  variation  and  play  an  important  role  in  hu-
man  evolution,  drug  sensitivity,  and  disease  sus-
ceptibility [4].  Due to advances in high-throughput 
experimental  techniques  for SNP  identification and 
the resulting data explosion, several machine learn-
ing  methods  have  been  applied  to  study  the  rela-
tionship  between  SNPs  and  disease  [3,5].  Algo-
rithms  such  as MegaSNPHunter  achieve  good  per-
formance  by  avoiding  the  computationally  intrac-
table  combinatorial  search  space,  but  they  are  lim-
ited  by  the  inability  to  use  a  large  number  of SNPs 
in disparate genomic locations [3].  Other machine  
  

 
 
learning approaches have been successfully applied 
to  disease  risk  prediction  using  SNP  data  [5],  but 
these  methods  have  not  yet  been  applied  to  onset 
prediction. 
    Therefore, we will  leverage a multiple-SNP ap-
proach  to  create  a  novel  predictive  model  of  both 
disease  risk  and  age  of  disease  onset.   Our  project 
aims  to  improve  performance  of  disease  risk  and 
age  of  onset  assessment,  and  to  bring  us  closer  to 
personalized  preventative  treatment  for  complex 
diseases.  
  
2. Methods 
 
2.1 Dataset 
     We  have  obtained  SNP  data  from  genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) performed by the 
Wellcome  Trust  Case  Control  Consortium 
(WTCCC).   This  dataset  is  comprised  of  the  SNP 
genotypes  for  3,000  healthy  controls  and  14,000 
diseased  patients,  all  genotyped  at  500,568  ge-
nomic  locations  [1].   The  patient  populations  are 
equally  sized  for  seven  complex  genetic  diseases 
(Table  1).   Age  of  disease  onset  is  available  for 
three  of  the  diseases  and  is  binned  by  decade.  
There  is  sufficient  spread  in  age  of  onset  to  enable 
subpopulation studies.

2.2 Data filtering 
    We have removed patient data and SNP data from 
our set for  the following reasons: 1) patients missing 
more  than  3%  of  SNP  data,  2)  genotype  calls  that 
disagree between  the  two  calling  algorithms used by 
the WTCCC,  and  3)  satisfying  other  exclusion  crite-
ria  specified  by  the  WTCCC  (poor  data  quality,  in-
correct genotyping, etc). 
  
2.3 Classification 
We  used  the  LIBSVM  software  package [6] to 
build  support  vector machine classifiers.  All  binary 
classifiers  and  multi-class  classifiers  were  built  us-
ing C-support  vector  classification, which  solves  the 
primal problem  (1) with C  set  to 2. We used a  radial 
basis kernel function (2) with gamma set  to 2-15.   Pa-
rameter  values  were  optimized  for  a  single  binary 
classifier  using  a  grid  search  over  a  range  of  values. 
Due  to  the  computational  complexity  of  this  optimi-
zation  problem, these  parameters  were  not  re-
optimized for each classifier.

2.3.1  Disease risk: 
    For  each  disease,  we  trained  a binary  classifier to 
distinguish  between  disease  and control.  To  balance 
training  set  sizes  for  disease  samples  and  control 
samples,  we selected  a random  sample  of  pa-
tients from  the  larger  group.   In  each  case,  the  total 
training  set  size  averaged  around  3600  individuals 
(half disease, half control). 
 
2.3.2  Early onset risk: 
    For  the  three  diseases with  onset  data  (CAD,  CD, 
and  T2D),  we  trained  a binary  classifier to  identify 
patients  at  risk  for  early  onset.  We  partitioned  the 
dataset  into early onset and  late onset groups  to  train 
the  classifier.  To  balance  training  set  sizes  for  early 
and  late  onset  groups, we  used multiple  iterations  of 
bootstrapping  and  ensured  performance  was  not 
based on the selected individuals. 
 
2.4 Feature Representation 
    For  each  SNP,  major  and  minor  alleles  were  de-
fined based on allele frequencies in the control popu- 

 
lation (where  the major  allele  is  the more  frequently 
observed  allele).  These  annotations provided  a  con-
sistent  allele  nomenclature  for representing all  pa-
tient  SNP  vectors.   Representation  of  each  SNP  re-
quired  two  values,  the  first  of  which  indicated  the 
presence/absence  of  genotype  information  and  the 
second  of  which  encoded  the  genotype.   Pres-
ence and absence corresponded  to  values  of  100  and 
0 respectively.   These  values  provided  a  means  of 
accounting  for  missing  data  without  disrupting  our 
genotype 
representations.  Genotype 
information 
(minor/minor,  minor/major,  major/major)  corre-
sponded  to  values  of  100,  50,  and  0  respectively.  
This  labeling  scheme makes  the  assumption  that  the 
phenotypic  effect  of  a  SNP  is  linearly  dependent 
upon the major (or minor) allele. 
 
2.5 Feature Selection 
    Our  feature  space  of  500,568  SNPs  far  exceeds 
the  number  of  individuals  available  for  training  our 
machine  learning  algorithms.  We  therefore  reduced 
our  feature  dimensionality  by  filtering  SNPs  based 
on  strength  of  disease  association  and  on  chromo-
somal  proximity,  which  prevents  overrepresentation 
of  genomic  loci.   We  measured  disease  association 
for each SNP by calculating a chi-square p-value  for 
the difference  between  the SNP  genotype  distribu-
tions  of  diseased  patients versus  that  of  control  indi-
viduals.   These  measures  of  significance  allowed  us 
to  rank  SNPs  for  feature  selection  for  both  disease 
risk prediction  and  early onset  risk prediction  for  in-
dividual  diseases.   To  filter  by  chromosomal  prox-
imity,  we  first  clustered  our  set  of  top  ranked  SNPs 
by  single  linkage  clustering  using  HapMap  linkage 
disequilibrium  r2  values  as  our  pair-wise  dis-
tances [7].  We then selected the SNPs with the most 
significant p-value within a given cluster and filtered 
out all other SNPs. 
  
 2.5.1  Disease risk using binary classifiers 
    As  described  above,  SNPs  were  ranked  by  chi-
square  p-value  for  each  disease,  where  SNPs  with 
the lowest p-value received the highest ranking.  The 
number  of  top  ranked  SNPs  selected  from  each  dis-
ease was optimized by empirical  testing using multi-
ple  iterations  of  SVM  training.    The  top  30  SNPs 
from  T1D  and  the  top  75  SNPs  from  all  other  dis-
eases  were  selected  as  our  final  feature  vectors by 
the  disease  association  ranking  step.  75  SNPs  gave 
the  best  performance  for  all  diseases  except  T1D,  in 
which  case  more  than  30  SNPs  did  not  improve  the 
performance. 

2.5.2  Early onset risk using binary classifiers 
    SNPs  were 
ranked  by  chi-square  p-value, 
where p-values were calculated based  on  the  SNP 
genotype  distributions  for 'early-onset'  versus  'late-
onset' groups.  The top 30 SNPs were selected as our 
preliminary feature vector.  The number 30 was cho-
sen to prevent overfitting, as the smallest training set 
had  around  300  patients.  The  linkage  disequilibrium 
filtering  step  was  then  applied  to  the  preliminary 
vectors to obtain final feature vectors. 
  
2.6 Validation 
    We performed 20-fold cross validation on  the dis-
ease  risk  and  age  of  onset  classifiers  discussed 
above.   We  calculated  performance  metrics  includ-
ing  prediction  accuracy,  false  positive  rate,  ROC 
curves,  and  AUC  (area  under  ROC  curve)  to  as-
sess classifier performance.  We 
also 
performed 
classification  with 20 random  sets  of 24 SNPs  (per-
mutation  testing)  and  compared  the  performance  of 
our  feature  sets  with  the  random  sets.    This  process 
allowed  us  to  determine  the  baseline  performance 
for  our  learning  method  and  whether  our  selected 
features outperformed this baseline significantly. 
    To evaluate the biological significance of our SNP 
profiles  for  disease  risk  and  age  of  onset  prediction, 
we  built  a  pipeline  to  identify  genes,  pathways,  and 
other  biological  features associated  with our  SNP 
feature  vectors (Figure  1).  We  used  Ensembl  Bio-
mart  [12] to  generate  the  list  of  Ensemble  Gene  IDs 
associated  with  a  given  SNP  vector  and  then  used 
the  Clone/Gene  ID  Converter  [13]  to  determine  the 
Kegg  pathways  in  which  these  genes  are  involved 
[14].   Finally,  we  manually  examined  the  retrieved 
Kegg pathways  to  look  for biological  relevance with 
respect to the original classification problem.

sets 
  
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Disease risk 

    The ROC curves  for  the  seven binary disease pre-
dictors  are  shown  in  Figure  2.   The  classifier  for 
Type  1  diabetes  has  the  best  performance,  while  the 
other  classifiers  have  only  moderate  performance.   
These  results are likely  due  to  the  fact that  several 
genomic  regions  contribute  strongly  towards  the 
T1D phenotype.  This conjecture  is  supported by  the 
fact that  T1D  had a  few SNPs  with  very  significant 
p-values  (on  the  order  of 1E-200)  while  the  other 
diseases  had  less  significant  SNP  p-values.  The 
quality  of  the T1D  result, which matches  or  exceeds 
the  predictive  accuracy  achieved  by  prior  methods 
[8], justifies  our  approach  of  ranking  SNPs  by  p-
value in order to capture the most discriminating fea-
tures.  The performance of  the other disease  classifi-
ers  suggests  that  the 500K genotyped SNPs does not 
include  those  that  co-segregate  with  highly  influen-
tial genetic loci.

ease risk 
 
3.2 Early onset risk 
   Using  values  from  recent  literature,  which  linked 
SNPs and  clinical  findings to  disease  onset  groups 
[9-11],  we  derived medically relevant  cutoff  ages  to 
partition  the  dataset  into  early  onset  and  late  onset 
groups  (Figure  3).  We  tested  variations in  our  train-
ing  data where  we  shifted  the  cutoff  by  one  decade 
and  where  we  removed  training  data  for  patients 
within  one  decade  of  the  cutoff.    The  reasoning  be-
hind  this  second  method  is  that  onset-differentiating 
SNPs may  present  a  stronger  signal  between  the  ex-
tremes  of  the  onset  populations.   Furthermore,  be-
cause literature definitions for early onset versus late 
onset  were  imprecise,  removing  the  patients  in  the 
age  categories  adjacent  to  our  cutoffs  produced  a 

training  set  with  higher  quality  class  labels.    For  all 
partitioned  datasets,  we  performed  permutation  test-
ing  and  found  the  random  sets  of  SNPs  to  achieve  a 
mean AUC no greater than 0.49 with standard devia-
tion  0.05.  For  each  disease,  we  then  selected  the 

best  performing  onset  classifier  from  the  above 
variations  (highlighted  in Figure 4).   The  large AUC 
values  for  these  classifiers  indicate  that  the  selected 
SNP  subsets  have  strong  predictive  power  for  early 
versus late onset.

3.3 Biological validation 
For  each  disease  classifier,  our  biological  feature 
pipeline  described  in  2.6  yielded  biological  path-
ways  involved in that  disease's  mechanism,  and  for 
each  onset  classifier,  the  pipeline  yielded  pathways 
 

implicated  in  aging  and  diet.   These  pathway  asso-
ciations  present  strong  evidence  that  our  SNP  vec-
tors have biological relevance and are not artifacts of 
the learning process (Table 2).

Conclusion 
 

We  have  developed  a  diagnostic  tool  to  predict 
both  disease  risk  and  risk  of  early  disease  onset 
given  an  individual’s  genetic  information.  Our  re-
sults  indicate  a  low  dimensional  patient  SNP  profile 
can  be  used  for  effective  risk  assessment  for  type  1 
diabetes,  and  that  the  WTCCC  patient  data  set  con-
tains  sufficient  information  for  the  construction  of 
disease  onset  classifiers.   Further  work  on  onset 
classification  promises  to  yield  effective early  onset 
prediction and preventative methods both for clinical 
use  and  for  the  rapidly  expanding  field  of  personal-
ized medicine.
