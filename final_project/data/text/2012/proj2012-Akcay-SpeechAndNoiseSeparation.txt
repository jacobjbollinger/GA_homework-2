 INTRODUCTION 
I. 
Speech  processing  is  a  highly  popular  research  subject.  As 
it  is  a  common  problem  in  all  signal  processing  tasks,  speech 
processing 
is  also  adversely  affected  by  noise 
in 
the 
environment.  
One of the applications  that is highly  susceptible to noise is 
indubitably  speech  recognition.  Intuitively  thinking  about  it, 
the task is to identify words from a speech signal. If this system 
is  going  to be  useful  it  has  to be  invariant  to different  speakers 
(different  pitch,  timbre,  etc.)  so  for  example  if  there  are 
multiple  people  speaking  (i.e.  the  noise  is  a  superposition  of 
other  speech  signals) 
this  should  obviously  deteriorate 
performance. This in fact is the truth as described in [1].  
There  is  a  great  deal  of  literature  on  this  topic.  Various 
methods are  used,  such as blind  source  separation  [3],  utilizing 
neural  networks  [4],  using  probabilistic  models  [2],  using 
multiple  microphones  to  utilize  the  spatial  difference  of  the 
sources, etc. Here I will focus on machine learning approaches. 
Speech  signals  are  quasi-periodic  signals  (whose  periods 
are  called  pitch)  [1].  This  is  largely  due  to  our  vocal  cords 
generating  a  periodic  sound  wave  which  is  modulated  in  our 
mouth, speech formation can be considered as a periodic signal 
(the  periodic  sound  waves)  being  passed  through  an  LTI  filter 
(the mouth) [1]. This nature of speech signals give them unique 
properties  that  can  be  exploited  for  detecting,  isolating  even 
separating  them.  The  fact  that  different  people’s  voices  have 
different  pitch  is  one  major  aspect  used  in  separation;  in  fact 
such  harmonic  characteristics  of  the  signal  can  be  very  easily 
seen in a spectrogram [1] an example is in figure 1.  
The rest of the report will first present some of the literature 
on  the  topic.  Followed  by  a  short  summary  of  speech  signals 
that is relevant to the project and finally my method and results 
will be presented.

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW 
A.  Spectral Learning for Blind Seperation 
Bach  and  Jordan,  in  [3]  investigate  a  method  for  blind 
speech  separation  using  a  single  microphone.  Their  idea  is  to 
segment  the  spectrogram  of  the  given  signal  into  multiple 
disjoint segments such that each segment will correspond to the 
speech of one speaker.  
Firstly  they construct  feature vectors  for  speech  signals that 
can  be  used  for  separation.  They  use  non-harmonic  cues  such 
as  continuity  and  common  fate,  as  well  as  harmonic  cues  such 
as  pitch  and  timbre.  For  timbre  they  use  the  spectral  envelope 
and  for  the  pitch  cues  they  have  developed  a  novel  algorithm 
that  can  identify  multiple  pitches  in  a  windowed  portion  of  a 
speech  signal  and  their  corresponding  dominance  within  the 
window  (roughly  corresponding  to  amplitude  of  the  pitch.) 
Obviously  for  the  continuity  determination,  entire  spectrogram 
needs  to be used, as a  result  the  feature  space used  is very high 
dimensional.  They  use  an  efficient 
implementation  of 
parameterized  affinity  matrices  to  ultimately  perform  the 
segmentation. 

B.  An Approximation to the EM Algorithm 
In  [2], Frey et. al. propose  a different approach  for  learning 
noise from a single microphone recording of noisy speech. 
They  model  the  speech  and  noise  parts  of  the  signal  as 
independent  signals  consisting  of  a  mixture  of  Gaussian 
distributions  (GMM).  By  using  a  Mel  frequency  scale  [book] 
and  assuming  that  the  noise  and  speech  have  little  phase 
signal  to  be  |𝑌(𝑓)|2 ≈ |𝑆(𝑓)|2 + |𝑁(𝑓)|2  where  ‘S’  denotes 
correlation,  they  approximate  the  magnitude  squared  of  the 
speech and ‘N’ denotes noise. 
They  use  ALGONQUIN  to  obtain  the  posterior  probability 
distribution  using  a  vector  Taylor  series  approximation.  They 
use  this  approximated  probabilistic  inference method  as  the  E-
step  in  the  EM  algorithm  (I will  not  go  into  every  detail  here). 
Finally  by  approximating  a  lower  bound  on  the  data  (and 
refining it) They do the M-step of the EM algorithm.  
C.  Neural Networks 
Although  there  are  interesting  techniques  in  the  literature 
using  neural  networks  as  well.  I  found  that  these  techniques 
are not very  familiar  to me and  the aforementioned  ideas were 
more  interesting  given  that  we  are  learning  the  basic  theories 
behind them in class. 
 

III.  PRELIMINARIES 
Before  I  begin  with  my  results  I  would  like  to  give  a  brief 
overview of the speech concepts considered  
A.  The Logarithmic Frequency Phenomenon 
The  human  auditory  system  is  not  uniform  in  frequencies; 
the  perception  of  one  frequency  is  usually  very  different  than 
another  (less  or  more  sensitive)  and  usually  is  completely 
insensitive to any frequency below 20 Hz or above 20 KHz [1]. 
It  turns  out  that  the  human  sensitivity  to  sound  is  an 
approximately  logarithmic  function of  the  frequency  as well as 
the  amplitude  (we  are  not  interested  in  the  amplitude  in  this 
project),  this  is  why  it  is  a  commonly  employed  practice  to 
represent the  frequency  logarithmically  [1]. The Mel  frequency 
scale  is  one  such  logarithmic  frequency  scale  commonly  used 
in  a  variety  of  applications  from  estimating  the  vocal  tract 
frequency response to pitch determination [1]. 
B.  Cepstrum and the MFCC 
Cepstrum or cepstral analysis  is a  simple  transformation of 
the  frequency  spectrum of a  signal  such  that multiplications  in 
the  frequency  domain  (which  are  convolutions  in  the  time 
domain)  become  summations  in  the  quefrency  cepstrum, 
which  basically  means  the  logarithm  of  the  frequency 
spectrum.  
MFCC  (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)  is especially 
useful  in  determining  characteristics  of  a  speech  signal  (e.g. 
pitch  can  be  very  easily  determined  from  it).  MFCCs  are 
calculated  by  first  warping  the  magnitude  spectrum  of  the 
signal  to  the  Mel  scale  (which  is  done  by  a  Mel  filter  bank) 
followed  by  taking  the  logarithm  of  the  warped  magnitude 
spectrum and ultimately followed by a DCT [1]. 

The  resulting  coefficients  exhibit  great  difference  between 
speech  and  non-speech.  For  speech  signals  it  has  a  certain 
shape  in  the  low  quefrencies  (corresponding  to  the  vocal  tract 
filter  characteristic)  and  a  few  impulse  like  features  in  the 
higher  quefrencies  which  correspond  to  the  pitch  in  the 
speech.

IV.  THE SYSTEM 
A.  Identifying parts in the Signal that Contain Speech 
The  first  step  is  to  determine  which  frames  of  the  signal 
contain  speech. As described above  the MFCCs  for  speech and 
non-speech  signals  differ  in  nature. What  I  did  was  to  take  10 
different  speech  signals  from  split  them  into  25  ms  windows 
and  to  label  these  portions  of  the  signal  as  speech  or  non-
speech.  Obviously  such  a  short  duration  audio  signal  is  not 
enough for humans to perceive it as speech or non-speech even 
less  when  it  is  not  a  rectangular  but  a  Hann  window.  So  I 
labeled  these  windows  as  speech  or  non-speech  by  looking  at 
the histogram. 
After 
liblinear  package  for 
the 
labeling,  using 
the 
MATLAB I trained an SVM classifier on them. Ultimately this 
classifier was  used  on  the  speech windows  for  classification  as 
speech  and  non-speech.  In  total  there  was  512  features  for  the 
SVM. Note that even though 25 ms equals to 400 samples at 16 
KHz;  for  efficient  DFT  computation  I  preferred  a  512-point 
DFT of the 400-point window. 
This  classifier  achieves  approximately  12%  testing  error 
and  8%  training  error.  The  main  cause  for  the  error  is  my 
coarse labeling of the training data, unfortunately looking at the 
histogram  it  cannot  be  done  much  finer.  A  second  cause  is 
speech  is  not  always  periodic  pulses  modulated  in  the  vocal 
tract;  for  example  “sss” of    “shh”  kind of  sounds  are more  like 
white  noise  passing  through  the  vocal  tract  so  do  not  have  a 
very  distinct  MFCC  signature  as  do  the  voiced  syllables  [1]. 
And  a  second  source  of  error  is  some  windows  capture  both 
silence  and  speech  together.  Overall  these  effects  caused  a 
more than desired error rate but, still not unreasonably high. So 

I  decided  to  continue  with  this  method  instead  of  trying  more 
sophisticated  pitch  tracking  kind  of  algorithms  for  this 
classification. 
B.  The Denoising Process 
For  the  denoising  procedure  I  preferred  to  use  the 
approximate  EM  algorithm  described  above.  Now  I  will 
provide  some  further  details  on 
this  algorithm  called 
ALGONQUIN [2]. 
First  of  all  the  energy  spectrum  of  the  signal  plays  an 
important  role.  Their  approximation  which  follows  from  the 
assumption  that  the  noise and  speech are uncorrelated  is given 
|𝑌(𝑓)|2 ≈ |𝑆(𝑓)|2 + |𝑁(𝑓)|2                      (1) 
below: 
Let  y,  s  and  n  be  the  vector  of  logarithms  of  each  of  the 
𝑒 𝑦 ≈ 𝑒 𝑠 + 𝑒 𝑛 = 𝑒 𝑠 (1 + 𝑒 𝑛−𝑠 ) 
terms (for every value of f) in equation (1). Then we can write: 
The multiplication is element-wise. Taking the logarithm of 
𝑦 = 𝑔 �� 𝑠𝑛�� = 𝑠 + 𝑙𝑛(1 + 𝑒 𝑛−𝑠 )                   (2) 
the above expression we end up with the function below: 
assuming  the  errors  in  equation  (2)  to  have  a  Guassian 
distribution,  the  observation  probability  is  given  by  the 
𝑝(𝑦  | 𝑠, 𝑛) = 𝓝 �𝒚 ; 𝒈 �� 𝒔𝒏�� , 𝚿�                  (3) 
expression below: 
where  the 𝚿 is assumed  to be a diagonal  covariance matrix  for 
ease of implementation and simplicity. 
The prior distributions of  the  speech and  noise are  assumed 
to be independent mixture of Gaussians, which makes the prior 
𝑝(𝑠) = ∑ 𝑝(𝑐 𝑠 )𝑝(𝑠|𝑐 𝑠 )
,     𝑝(𝑐 𝑠 ) = π𝑐 𝑠𝑠 ,                  
probabilities of both as below: 
𝑐 𝑠
𝑝(𝑠  |𝑐 𝑠 ) =  𝓝�𝑠 ;   𝜇𝑐 𝑠𝑠 , Σ𝑐 𝑠𝑠 � 
𝑝(𝑛) = ∑ 𝑝(𝑐 𝑛 )𝑝(𝑠 |𝑐 𝑛 )
,     𝑝(𝑐 𝑛 ) = π𝑐𝑛𝑛 ,                  
𝑐𝑛
𝑝(𝑠  |𝑐 𝑛 ) =  𝓝�𝑠;   𝜇𝑐𝑛𝑛 , Σ𝑐𝑛𝑛 � 
where  cn  and  cs  are  the  noise  and  clean  speech  classes 
respectively  and  the  covariance  matrices  are  both  assumed  to 
be  diagonal.  Combining  the  priors  their  independence  and 
equation  (3)  for  the  conditional  probabilities  they  arrive  at  the 
𝑝(𝑦 , 𝑠, 𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑛 , 𝑐 𝑛 ) =
joint distribution below: 
 𝓝 �𝑦; 𝑔 ��𝑠𝑛�� , 𝚿� π𝑐 𝑠𝑠 𝓝�𝑠 ;   𝜇𝑐 𝑠𝑠 , Σ𝑐 𝑠𝑠 �π𝑐𝑛𝑛 𝓝�𝑠;   𝜇𝑐𝑛𝑛 , Σ𝑐𝑛𝑛 �   (4) 
As  we  can  see  with  this  joint  distribution 𝑝(𝑠 , 𝑛 | 𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑐 𝑛 , 𝑦) 
is  not  a  mixture  of  Gaussians  and  hence  to  use  an  EM 
algorithm  needs  some  further manipulation or  simplification of 
the distribution. 
This  is  done  by  approximating  the  posterior  probability  for 
the parameters of the current noisy speech windows as below: 

𝑝(𝑠 , 𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑛, 𝑐 𝑛 |𝑦) ≈ 𝑞(𝑠 , 𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑛, 𝑐 𝑛 ) =
� , �Φ𝑐 𝑠 𝑐𝑛𝑠𝑠
Φ𝑐 𝑠𝑐𝑛𝑠𝑛
 𝓝 ��𝑠𝑠� ; �𝜂𝑐 𝑠 𝑐𝑛𝑠𝜂𝑐 𝑠 𝑐𝑛𝑛
Φ𝑐 𝑠𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑛 ��               (5) 
Φ𝑐 𝑠 𝑐𝑛𝑠𝑛
 and  𝜂𝑐 𝑠 𝑐𝑛𝑛
where  𝜂𝑐 𝑠 𝑐𝑛𝑠
speech  and  noise  for  the  aforementioned  classes.  The Φ’s  are 
 are  the  approximated  means  of  the 
the  covariances  between  the  speech  and  noise  according  to 
their superscript and all of them are diagonal; this follows from 
the assumed priors. 
So  the  approximated  posterior  for  one  window  is  given  as 
𝑞(𝑠 , 𝑛, 𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑐 𝑛 ) = 𝑞(𝑠 , 𝑛 | 𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑐 𝑛 )𝑞(𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑐 𝑛 ) 
below: 
where 𝑞(𝑐 𝑠 , 𝑐 𝑛 )  is  the  mixing  proportion  for  the  speech  and 
noise classes. 
So  the  goal  is  to minimize  the  relative  entropy  between  the 
p  and  q  distributions  aforementioned.    Since  the  relative 
entropy  is  in  effect  a  measure  of  the  difference  of  two 
probability  distributions.  Also  note  that  ln[p(y)]  does  not 
depend on any of the variational parameters defined before and 
minimizing 
to 
(RL)  corresponds 
relative  entropy 
the 
maximizing  ln[p(y)]  –  RL  which  is  a  lower  bound  on  the  log-
likelihood. 
As  a  result  this  method  called  variational  inference  can  be 
used to approximate an E step in the well-known EM algorithm 
[6]. 
Also  note 
introduces  non-
the  relative  entropy 
that 
Gaussianness  into  assumed  Gaussian  distributions.  This  is 
prevented  by  using  a  second  order  taylor  series  approximation 
to  the  relative  entropy  computation.  The  full  update  equations 
are pretty lengthy and won’t fit into a double column formatted 
paper  in  a  readable  manner  so  interested  reader  is  encouraged 
to  check  out  [2]  for  the  full  equations  as  well  as  certain 
derivational details that I omitted here for brevity. 
V.  RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
My  data  was  taken  from  the  PASCAL  ChiMe  challenge.  I 
corrupted  the  data  by  additive  white  Gaussian  noise  with 
varying  SNR  values.  The  overall  system  was  able  to  achieve 
between  6  dB  to  10  dB  improvement  in  the  SNR  (compared 
against  the  pure  speech)  the  improvement  does  not  depend 
much  on  the  input  SNR.  Different  speech  signals  with  same 
SNR  sometimes  produced  5.98  dB  and  10.13  dB.  The  one 
thing  that  has  to  be  really  worked  on  is  a  higher  accuracy 
speech 
and 
non-speech 
classifier, 
because 
this 
misclassification  ends  up  pretty  audible  at  times  (you  here 
sudden onset of high white noise). I am not very satisfied with 
the  results,  I  thought  ~20dB  would  have  been  possible.  In  [2] 
they  do  not  provide  a  SNR  analysis.  They  just  provide  the 
improvement achieved in a sample speech recognition task. 
VI.  CONCLUSION 
This  project  firstly  gave  me  the  chance  to  explore  a  very 
interesting  field 
in  signal  processing  which 
is  speech 
processing.  Such  an  extensive  literature  survey  provided  a 
great  depth  in  usages  of  machine  learning  as  a  noise 
cancellation  technique.  Also  to  implement  an  EM  algorithm 

for  the  final  system  gave  the  opportunity  to  solidify  my 
understanding  of  the  EM  method.  All  in  all  I  have  benefited 
from the project greatly.
